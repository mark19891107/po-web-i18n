  what:
    title: What is open government?
    content0: The open government was proposed by an international organization called OGP (Open Government Partnership)：
    content1: 「......Adhering to open value and engaging with citizens to improve services, manage public resources, drive innovation and build safer communities. With the principle of transparency and open government, we will achieve prosperity, well-being and a society in line with human dignity in our own country and in an increasingly connected world.......」
    content2: The four visions of an open government, that is, the future we look forward to, are a transparent government, a participating government, a responsible government, and a government that embraces it.
  why:
    title: Why open government?
    content: The higher the foundation of trust between the public sector and the public, the higher the opportunity for us to have sound public policies. On the other hand, if there is a lack of mutual trust, the discussion of the topic may be out of focus, and it may also cause public policy to vacillate and pay huge social costs. Therefore, <a class="text-highlight"> mutual trust between the public sector and the public is the ultimate goal of an open government. </a>

  how:
    title: How to promote open government?
    content: <a class="text-highlight">To promote open government, we must start by changing the official culture. </a> If the civil servants who actually promote the policy can be used as locomotives, they will adopt a more open approach and a mentality output policy. In the long run, the policy can determine the direction as early as possible and can do things better. In other words, changing the official culture is like a sewer project. Although it is invisible, it will certainly feel a significant change in the long run.

  who:
    title: Who will promote open government?
    content: Open government is everyone's business. Therefore, we need people who are willing to participate in the policy-driven process, civil servants who can share practical experience, and government officials who can take responsibility. Therefore, the "Partication Officer" assigned by each ministry is to change the official culture and deepen the "seeds" of the open government.

  points:
    title: Four elements of open government
    content: What is an open government? To put it simply, in the process of formulating public policies, gradually putting the four elements of transparency, participation, responsibilities and tolerance into it is the way to open the government. But specifically, what should be done?
    list:
      - title: Transparency
        img: 1 _ 透明.png
        content: Politics is a matter for everyone, and the policy process should allow everyone to clearly understand what happened. Friends in the public sector may be worried that if the outside world directly sees these undecided communication processes, will there be problems? In fact, the sooner the information is provided, the easier it is for the public to understand the preparations made by the public sector, the public sector can save the effort and time of repeated communication, and further reduce the communication burden of the public sector.
      - title: Participation
        img: 1 _ 參與.png
        content: In the process of policy formation, the public has the opportunity to participate in discussions, express opinions, and even further influence the content of the policy. In this way, although the public sector needs to spend more time to build consensus, after the policy is formed, the risk of being opposed or even turning over is less.
      - title: Accountability
        img: 1 _ 課責.png
        content: When the public has doubts about the policy formation process, can they review the opinion and who is proposing this opinion? What are the reasons for adoption or non-adoption? Through the mechanism of "accepting accountability and giving accountability", we will establish a culture of "responsibility" so that everyone can take the initiative to be responsible for their own opinions.
      - title: Inclusion
        img: 1 _ 涵容.png
        content: Public issues involve a wide range of topics. If the public sector allows the multi-stakeholders directly affected by the policy to fully express their opinions and listen to each other during the discussion of the issue, they can collect as many opinions as possible and reduce policy occurrence. The possibility of error.
    summary: These four elements will be interlocked to achieve the vision of an open government. If there is only transparency, but there is no class responsibility; or if there is participation, but there is no tolerance, open government will have serious problems, open form, but no open spirit, become "open washing".

      - title: Translate
        content: PO is like translating rice cakes, assisting colleagues in the public sector to understand the words of netizens, and helping netizens to understand the words of the public sector. After all, if the two sides have different understandings of the same thing, they will not be able to communicate.
        img: 2 _ 轉譯.png

# Collaborative workshop ========================================================

workshop:
  what: 
    title: What is Collaborative workshop?
    content: >
      We have mastered the concept of open government (transparency, participation, responsibilities, tolerance), and how to promote public-private partnerships after promoting the seeds of open government (PO). The way we choose is "collaborative meeting."


      What is "collaboration"? "Collaboration" is：Everyone's philosophy and goals are different for a certain topic, but they all want to contribute. Therefore, everyone discusses, listens to each other, tries to find a consensus, and from then on, thinks about solutions. In the end, I hope to achieve the result that "meeting output is not the result I want most, but it does not violate my philosophy and can be accepted."


      There are various methods and tools for practicing open government. We only design the form of "collaborative meeting". Different topic attributes may have different processes and forms. In any form, the most important thing is the spirit of the four open governments of transparency, participation, responsibility and tolerance.

  intro:
    - title: Purpose of the collaborative workshop
      content: The Collaborative Conference is a regular conference platform. It is hoped that it will assist the organisers of each public issue to listen to diverse opinions and create more opportunities for dialogue between agencies and agencies, between agencies and the public. Through collaboration, friends and the public in the public sector can work together to clarify issues and find possible solutions as much as possible. It will also enable the ministries to make good use of relevant policy thinking, design and tools, and gradually become familiar with the spirit of open government.
    - title: Topics of collaborative workshop
      content: There are many topics suitable for collaboration, including various types of inter-departmental policy coordination, "information system implementation" and "pre-policy opinion collection". Depending on the nature of the topic, the goals that collaborative workshop can achieve are not necessarily the same. Some issues involve conflicts of values. Through collaborative workshop, they can be clarified to a certain extent and made visible to decision-making points. On topics with high technical content, they can understand the opinions of different stakeholders through the collaborative meeting and incorporate them into the process of service design. There are also issues in which the public sector is already planning, but the public does not necessarily understand that collaborative workshop can inform the public about policy progress and provide folk experience for planning reference.
    - title: Challenges of collaborative workshop
      content: Collaborative workshop still face many challenges. In collaborative workshop, listening and discussion between interested parties is quite valuable, but if there is sufficient speech and dialogue, there should not be too many participants in the collaborative meeting, considering the time each person can speak, five hours. The number of participants is preferably no more than forty. In addition, the most valuable dialogue process of the collaborative meeting is difficult to convey through text reports or oral communication. As a result, friends who are not involved in a collaborative meeting may not be able to understand all the discussion processes of the collaborative meeting, or see the text in the collaborative meeting, and have different ideas, which may result in the results of the collaborative meeting not being fully conveyed. It may not be acceptable.

  how:
    title: How to do a collaborative workshop?
    content: There is no need for a very large project to hold a collaborative meeting, but there is a certain structure for reference. We encourage our public sector friends to use their own processes and tools to conduct collaborative meetings to discuss issues and seek solutions with multiple stakeholders.
